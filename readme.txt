== Description ==

**GeoContacts is a geoencoding address book plugin with Gravatar and template support. GeoContacts will display
single contacts or your whole address book in your posts. No other address book plugin can do everything GeoContacts
does. The Google API is used to geocode and Google maps are used to fine tune coordinate selection in the back-end.**

GeoContacts is ideal to create review sites or for displaying your personal contact list.

With GeoContacts you can edit addresses and geocode in the administration interface. Then embed a list of contacts or a single contact in posts and pages using post anchors. No hard to use disappearing html code here. Anchors look like GEOCONTACT[], so you can use your favorite blogging client with ease.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Why don't I see a map in the edit screen?
You must install a valid Google key in options first. It is free.

Google is evil. Can I use GeoContacts without installing a Google key?
You can use GeoContacts without a Google key. However you will not have geoencoding available.

I can't find the templates. 
Templates are located in the template subfolder of this plug-in.

I made this really awesome template but it was named default.htm. I installed the plug-in update and now I 
only have the template that came with the plug-in.
It is recommended that if you make changes, or create new templates that you back them up.

How do I change the sort order of my contact list when I display it on my site?
Change the 'Sort full contact list display by' option.

2. Contact edit page. This is where you can geocode an address and use the map to fine tune your coordinates.
3. An anchor in use. This anchor selects contact id 1 and the hcard.htm template.
